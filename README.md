# Genetic-Algorithm-Simulator

-This project has been developed to visualize genetic algorithm being applied to textual data.

[Workflow]
> [1] An initial population of chromosomes is generated, where each chromosome consists of a unique combination of alphanumeric + special characters ( genes ). \
> [2] For each iterative generation, a fraction of fittest offsprings from the previous generation is selected to be passed onto the next generation. \
> [3] The algorithm uses target chromosome to measure the fitness score of each chromosome, where the fitness score is proportional to the degree of similarity between target and the corresponding chromosome.

Feel free to play with the target and parameters used in the intermediate steps ( selection, crossover, mutation ) to observe diversity within the simulation.
